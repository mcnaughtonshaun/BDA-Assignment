# Introduction 

Sports prediction is a branch of statistics that has been growing in the last decade. This growth is related not only to the large monetary amounts involved in betting but also to the access to information that could mean a competitive advantage for certain teams. Due to the diversity that exists between sports, the projects will be focused to study doubles tournmanets of tennis. More particularly, we will focus on Wimbledon 2019. The idea of the project is to use rating of each individual player together with set difference in previous matches of the tournament to estimate the outcome of future matches. 
The primary aim is to describe two models that enable the prediction of tennis events. To establish a consistent approach, the methodology followed can be divided into different steps: data collection, model application and convergence and performance analysis. 

As you probably already know, tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). A tennis match is composed of points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games (a minimum of six), which in turn each consist of points. A set is won by the first side to win 6 games, with a margin of at least 2 games over the other side (e.g. 6–3 or 7–5). If the set is tied at six games each, a tie-break is usually played to decide the set. A match is won when a player or a doubles team has won the majority of the prescribed number of sets. Matches employ either a best-of-three or best-of-five set format. In professional tennis, the four Grand Slam tournaments are particularly popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass cours, and the US Open also palyed in hard courts. These Grand Slams are organized as single-elimination tournaments, with competitors being eliminated after a single loss and matches follow the best-of-five format. The brackets are seeded according to a recognised ranking system, in order to keep the best players in the field from facing each other until as late in the tournament as possible. 

We will focus on the championship of Wimbledon, the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament in the world. The championship has five main events: gentlement's singles, ladies' singles, gentlement's doubles, ladies' doubles and mixed doubles. We will be using data from gentlement's doubles Wimbledon 2019 tournament. 


## Dataset explanation (rating + Wimbeldon games)


## General view of the project:  "We will use two different models and compare their performance..." + "parameters that we are considering relevant"+"why do we think rating is not 100% accurate" + ...
