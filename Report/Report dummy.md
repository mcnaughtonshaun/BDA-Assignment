# Introduction 

- Introduction (motivation of the project)

- Tennis game and Wimbeldon explanation

- Dataset explanation (rating + Wimbeldon games)

- General view of the project:  "We will use two different models and compare their performance...

Maybe some theory background about Rhat, prior distributions, loo ... ¿¿?¿?
